            <h3>Desciption</h3>
            <p>
                A perfectly seasoned and juicy turkey. My friend from France taught me to cook turkey like this, but she never measures
                anything so use your own judgement for vegetable amounts, etc. I usually err on the side of 'more is better'.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
                <li> 2 cups kosher salt</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
                <li> 2 large onions, peeled and chopped</li>
                <li> 4 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
                <li> 4 stalks celery, chopped</li>
                <li> 2 springs fresh thyme</li>
                <li> 1 bay leaf</li>
                <li> 1 cup dry white wine</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol> Step 1 <br><br>
                <li>
                    Rub the turkey inside and out with the kosher salt. Place the bird in a large stock pot, and cover with cold water.
                    Place in the refrigetor, and allow the turkey to soak in the salt and water mixture 12 hours, or overnight.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol> Step 2 <br><br>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughky rinse the turkey, and discard the brine mixture.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol> Step 3 <br><br>
                <li>
                    Brush the turkey with 1/2 the melted butter. Place breast side dowm on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan.
                    Stuff the turkey cavity with 1 onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and the bay leaf. Scatter
                    the remaning vegetables and thyme around the bottom of the roasting pan, and cover with the white wine.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol> Step 4 <br><br>
                <li>
                    Roast uncovered 3 1/2 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, untill the internal temparature of the thigh reaches 180 degrees
                    F (85 degrees C). Carefully turn the turkey breast side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and bush with the remaining
                    butter. Allow the bird to stand about 30 minutes before carving.
                </li>
            </ol><br><br>
